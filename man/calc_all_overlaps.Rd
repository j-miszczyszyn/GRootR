\title{Calculate all pairwise root system overlaps}
\usage{
calc_all_overlaps(hulls, tree_id_col = "TREE_ID", digits = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{hulls}{An sf object with convex hull polygons. Must have a tree ID column.}

\item{tree_id_col}{Name of tree ID column. Default \code{"TREE_ID"}.}

\item{digits}{Number of decimal places to round. Default \code{2}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns: \code{tree_1}, \code{tree_2}, \code{overlap_area},
\code{overlap_pct_tree1}, \code{overlap_pct_tree2}. Rows with zero overlap are excluded.
}
\description{
Computes overlap statistics for all pairs of trees in a convex hull dataset.
