\title{Propagate tree name to all segments of the same root}
\usage{
propagate_tree_name(joined, tree_id_col = "TREE_ID")
}
\arguments{
\item{joined}{An sf object from \code{\link[=join_nearest_tree]{join_nearest_tree()}}, containing
\code{ROOT_ID} and a tree ID column (possibly with NAs).}

\item{tree_id_col}{Name of the tree identifier column. Default \code{"TREE_ID"}.}
}
\value{
An sf object where all segments of a root share the same tree ID.
Roots with no matched tree are removed.
}
\description{
After spatial join, only segments near the tree base get the tree ID.
This function propagates the tree ID to ALL segments sharing the same ROOT_ID.
}
