}
\arguments{
\item{roots}{An sf object with root segments.}

\item{trees}{An sf point object with tree locations. Must contain a
column identifying each tree.}

\item{tree_id_col}{Name of the tree identifier column in \code{trees}.
Default \code{"TREE_ID"}.}

\item{max_dist}{Maximum distance (in CRS units) for the join. Default \code{1.5}.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Performs a spatial join between root segments and tree point locations,
matching within a given distance threshold.
