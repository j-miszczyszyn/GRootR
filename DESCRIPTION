Description: Tools for processing and analyzing tree root system data obtained 
    from Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) with 3D scanning capabilities. Converts 
    raw CSV point data into spatial line segments, calculates geometric metrics 
    (3D length, azimuth, inclination, depth), joins roots with tree stem locations, 
    builds 2D convex hull polygons representing root system spread, estimates 3D 
    bounding volume, and analyzes inter-tree root overlap competition. Developed 
    as part of the NCN-funded project "Application of Ground-Penetrating Radar 
    with 3D Scanner for Measuring Variability in Scots Pine Root Systems".
