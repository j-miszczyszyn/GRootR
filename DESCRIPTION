Description: The GRootR package provides tools for visualizing tree root systems 
    detected using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). It supports the transformation 
    of GPR-generated CSV files into 3D visualizations and includes functions for 
    basic statistical analyses of root distribution, density, and spatial arrangement. 
    Designed for forestry researchers and soil scientists, this package helps 
    streamline data interpretation and enhance insights into subsurface root systems.
